Question1: If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
Answer1: By average energy, valence and danceability.
Question2: Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
Answer2: The way I’ve calculated this aura is not very representative of the listener, because average energy, valence and danceability are very vague ways. I propose to calculate aura by genre diversity, personalization, top songs by year, rating, mood (i.e. energy hip-hop).
